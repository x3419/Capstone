Digital Forensics Triage Tool

### Abstract
For my capstone project, I decided to create a digital forensics triage tool. The motivation behind this project was illuminated through my experience at my internship over the summer - I found that, while learning to use various digital forensics tools, it would require extra programming to bundle different tools together for deployment; this was a static process that would inevitably need to be modified when adding tools and features. While manually programming a way in which tools can be triaged (organized based on priority) is definitely a way of precisely providing a software solution for this problem, the static nature of how it was implemented had room for improvement. This project is aiming to solve that problem, by providing an interface that can automate the process of deploying various tools dynamically, without providing extra programming. Though this project has application beyond digital forensics, this was my initial motivation so I have catered the UI and features around this target audience. Furthermore, this tool can be used with or without the use of deployment. In my testing, I have found that the results of this project reflect my initial goal, and I hope that the users of this software find that as well.
